# Crappy Code Everyday

After reading [an article about shifting from consumer mindset to producer mindset](https://medium.com/the-ascent/how-to-shift-your-mindset-from-consumer-to-producer-413a80fe1e7c), I realized that I've been trying to "shooting star" in my coding career, I've been aiming a very high standard and end up not progressing at all.

So now, I will try to do a different approach. I'll try becoming a **doer** that do coding everyday, and set the bar to absolute minimum (crappy), to increase throughput.

Maybe I'll update the list of what I'm doing everyday here. Maybe in a form of list of repositories. I don't know, we'll see, I'm just getting started after all.
